qBittorrent - A BitTorrent client in C++ / Qt4.2
------------------------------------------

*** Necessary if qt3 is default on your system ***
export QTDIR=/usr/include/qt4
export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$QTDIR/lib
*** End ***

./configure
make && make install
qbittorrent

will install and execute qBittorrent hopefully without any problems.

Dependencies:
- Qt >= 4.2 (libqt-devel, libqtgui, libqtcore, libqtnetwork, libqtxml)

- rblibtorrent by Arvid Norberg (>= v0.13 REQUIRED)
    -> http://www.libtorrent.net
    Be careful: another library (the one used by rTorrent) use the same name.
    These are TWO different libraries and qBittorrent will only work with the one provided
    on sourceforge (created by Arvid Norberg). The two libraries conflicts with each other.

- libboost: libboost-filesystem, libboost-date-time, libboost-thread, libboost-serialization

- libcommoncpp2

- python >= 2.3 (needed by search engine)

- libmagick++ (advised, not required)

NOTE FOR NON-KDE USERS:
- qt4-qtconfig package is advised when using other systems than KDE.
  You can also change qBittorrent style to Cleanlooks (GNOME like)

DOCUMENTATION:
Please note that there is a documentation with a "compiling howto" at http://wiki.qbittorrent.org.
