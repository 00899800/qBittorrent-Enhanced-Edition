// in v0.10 (partial) - WIP
- Download from RSS feeds (WIP by gtsoul in RSS_SUPPORT branch, clean & finish rss.h, merge with trunk, add a tab in mainWindow, debug)
- Move finished torrent to another tab and keep on seeding them even after restart (better for sharing)
- Improve torrent creation dialog (look & features) :
    - Add Private combobox (allow to share on DHT or not)
    - Use a QListWidget to allow multiple input paths
    - Possibility to add url seeds
- Add IPv6 support (at least start working on it, libtorrent seems to support it, we should limit our code to IPv4 anymore)
- UPnP support (debug, sync with next aMule release (or CVS)) : seems to be working!
- Update v0.9.0 changelog after its release
- Display Url seeds in torrent properties and allow to edit them
- Improve Ipfilter.dat parser (move to a thread ? - too slow to load qBT and more importantly options)
- Use tooltips to explain options
- Exit confirmation only if there are active downloads (display number of downloads) - SMARTER
- Make use of QNetworkInterface (could be useful ?)
- Display more info in log (PeX, UPnP, DHT w/ ports...)
- Possibility to disable the trayicon
