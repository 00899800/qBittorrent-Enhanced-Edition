// Easy
- Translations into as many languages as possible
- Use Launchpad/Rosetta for translations once it supports TS files

// Intermediate
- Port on MacOS, Windows (and create an installer for Windows) - Slow progress
- Add some transparency (menus,...), improve look / usabilty
- Skins support? (contact Mateusz)

// Harder
- Torrent scheduler ala Âµtorrent/Bitcomet

// Waiting for libtorrent
- Allow to prioritize torrents (may code this in qBittorrent?)

// Unsure
- Display the peers we are connected to for each torrent with infos (like flag, dl/up speeds, ...)
- Azureus spoofing to prevent ban from trackers?
- Option to shutdown computer when downloads are finished
- NAT checker/Tester
- Display hard drive space left?
- Make use of dbus on Linux for the single instance instead of socket communication?

- When favicon can't be downloaded, try to parse the webpage for:
  <link rel="icon" href="http://example.com/favicon.ico" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon">
    * Be careful, the link can be relative
- Improve search plugin install (choose in a list taken from plugins.qbittorrent.org)
- support zipped torrents? (useful?)
- Allow to limit the number of downloading torrents simultaneously (other are paused until a download finishes)

// in v1.2.0

// in v1.1.0
