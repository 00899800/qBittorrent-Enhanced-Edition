// Easy
- Translations into as many languages as possible
- Improve man page

// Intermediate
- Port on MacOS, Windows (and create an installer for Windows) - Progressing
- Add some transparency (menus,...)

// Harder
- Allow user to organize the downloads into categories/folders
- Display new searches in new tabs
- Display a progress bar that really displays the pieces we have (like in eMule)

// Waiting for libtorrent
- File selection in a torrent in compact mode
- Allow to prioritize torrents

// Unsure
- Azureus spoofing to prevent ban from trackers?
- Web interface?
- Allow to set upload limit for each torrent
- Option to shutdown computer when downloads are finished
- Add a torrent scheduler
- Improve Ipfilter.dat parser (move to a thread ? - too slow to load qBT and more importantly options)
- Improve search plugin update (make it automatic, write version/changelog in another file to limit brandwidth usage). Allow to disable this feature in program preferences.
- Make use of dbus on Linux for the single instance instead of socket communication?
