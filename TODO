// Easy
- Write documentation
- Translations into as many languages as possible
- Improve man page
- Add more keyboard shortcuts
- Improve torrent creation tool (look & features)
- Allow user to choose DHT port
- Add button : delete from list and Hard drive

// Intermediate
- Move novaUpdater to a Thread (probably use downloadThread) to prevent GUI freezing
- Port on MacOS, Windows (and create an installer for Windows) - Progressing
- Allow to prioritize files within a torrent
- Allow to prioritize torrents
- Optimize code to use less memory/cpu
- Add some transparency (menus, OSD)
- Rewrite trayicon using QSystemTrayIcon class (waiting for Qt 4.2)
- Popup when adding a torrent (Save path, select files in the torrent...) (v0.8.0?)
- Display remaining HD space (check it before adding a new torrent?)
- Add a column "Tracker status"?
- Option to shutdown computer when downloads are finished

// Harder
- Allow user to organize the downloads into categories/folders
- Display new searches in new tabs
- Display a progress bar that really display the pieces we have (like in eMule)

// Unsure
- Move Speed/ratio to a status bar ?
- Azureus spoofing to prevent ban from trackers?
- Download from RSS?
- Encryption support (waiting for libtorrent)
- Split kernel from GUI? (would be a lot better but require some deep changes)
- Web interface?
