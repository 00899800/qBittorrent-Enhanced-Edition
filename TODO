// Easy
- Translations into as many languages as possible
- Use Launchpad/Rosetta for translations once it supports TS files

// Intermediate
- Port on MacOS, Windows (and create an installer for Windows) - Slow progress
- Add some transparency (menus,...), improve look / usabilty
- Skins support? (contact Mateusz)

// Harder
- Display a progress bar that really represents the pieces we have (like in eMule)

// Waiting for libtorrent
- File selection in a torrent in compact mode
- Allow to prioritize torrents (may code this in qBittorrent?)

// Unsure
- Azureus spoofing to prevent ban from trackers?
- Option to shutdown computer when downloads are finished
- Make use of dbus on Linux for the single instance instead of socket communication?
