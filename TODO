// Easy
- Write documentation
- Translations into as many languages as possible
- Improve man page
- Add more keyboard shortcuts

// Intermediate
- Port on MacOS, Windows (and create an installer for Windows) - Progressing
- Add some transparency (menus,...)
- Add upnp port forwarding support

// Harder
- Allow user to organize the downloads into categories/folders
- Display new searches in new tabs
- Display a progress bar that really displays the pieces we have (like in eMule)

// Waiting for libtorrent
- Encryption support (v0.13?)
- File selection in a torrent in compact mode
- Allow to prioritize files within a torrent
- Allow to prioritize torrents

// Unsure
- Azureus spoofing to prevent ban from trackers?
- Web interface?
- Use downloader class to download search plugin updates
- Allow to set upload limit for each torrent
- Option to shutdown computer when downloads are finished
- Add a torrent scheduler
- Improve Ipfilter.dat parser (move to a thread ? - too slow to load qBT and more importantly options)

// in v0.10 (partial) - WIP
- Download from RSS feeds (WIP by gtsoul, clean & finish rss.h, add a tab in mainWindow, debug)
- Move finished torrent to another tab and keep on seeding them even after restart (better for sharing)
- Improve torrent creation dialog (look & features) :
    - Add Private combobox (allow to share on DHT or not)
    - Use a QListWidget to allow multiple input paths
    - Possibility to add url seeds
- Add IPv6 support (at least start working on it, libtorrent seems to support it, we should limit our code to IPv4 anymore)
- Display Url seeds in torrent properties and allow to edit them
- Use tooltips to explain options?
- Display more info in log (UPnP)
- Update to libtorrent SVN (0.13)
    - Use its UPnP/NAT-PMP built-in support instead of ours
    - Use its piece prioritization support
- Tab support in search (maybe a bit later)
