// Easy
- Translations into as many languages as possible
- Improve man page
- Use Launchpad/Rosetta for translations once it supports TS files

// Intermediate
- Port on MacOS, Windows (and create an installer for Windows) - Progressing slowly
- Add some transparency (menus,...), improve look

// Harder
- Display a progress bar that really displays the pieces we have (like in eMule)
- .ico support (unsupported by Qt4.3 Free edition)

// Waiting for libtorrent
- File selection in a torrent in compact mode
- Allow to prioritize torrents

// Unsure
- Azureus spoofing to prevent ban from trackers?
- Option to shutdown computer when downloads are finished
- Add a torrent scheduler
- Make use of dbus on Linux for the single instance instead of socket communication?

- search engines customizing

// in v1.2.0
- Allow user to organize the downloads into categories/folders

- Allow to hide columns?
- Allow to scan multiple directories? (useful?)
- Web interface (turbogears? php?)
- improve and test tracker authentication code (remember login/pass) (need a tracker to test this)

- Allow to disable UPnP/NAT-PMP/LSD in options?
- Allow to automatically delete torrents when they reach a given ratio (in options) : easy

// in v1.0.0 (partial) - WIP
- Check storage st creation + hasher in torrent creation
